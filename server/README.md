Server
======

The Mevis server, which provides the backend for the mesh visualizer and is a spot
by itself.


## Structure

- example-network: files to setup and simulate a network for ngether / mevis
- node_modules: npm modules (could be refactored later as a package.json)
- static: a static file server to provide access via localhost
