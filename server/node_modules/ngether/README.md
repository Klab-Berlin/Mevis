ngether
=======

ngether is a websocket (engine.io) and bubPubSub based data distribution system.
It is primarily meant for allowing dynamically growing/shrinking server-meshworks to communicate and sync events/pubsubs

# features:

* connect multiple Spots to one Hub. 
* A Hub only receives incoming connections. 
* A Hub distributes spot-connect-info to newly connecting spots.
* A Spot will connect to and receive incoming connections from any other ngether instance. 
* An ngether group will auto-connect each node with each other node, building a meshwork.
* ngether has built-in modules for building a bubPubSub bridge from 'local' pubsubs to the meshwork. 
* ngether allows communication between mesh-nodes by addressing them in the bubpubsub topic: 
	/ngetherId/   : will send via direct connection to the named ngether instance (spot or hub)
* each ngether instance creates a REPL 

#	use: 

* ngether.emit  : to send a bubPubSub to the meshwork AND your own local bubpubsub instance
	ngether.emit(topicsArray/topicString, DataObject);
	myNG.emit('desktops/sync/emit', { a:1, b:2 } ); 
* ngether.broadcast  : to send a bubPubSub to the meshwork, but NOT to your own local bubpubsub instance
	ngether.broadcast(topicsArray/topicString, DataObject);
	myNG.broadcast('desktops/sync/broadcasting', { a:1, b:2 } );
* ngether.tell : to directly address a list of spots/hubs 
	ngether.tell(topicsArray/topicString, DataObject, targetArray/targetString);
	myNG.tell('desktops/sync/bla', { a:1, b:2 }, [ 'ngetherSpot02_9992_1222' ]);
	myNG.tell('desktops/sync/bla', { a:1, b:2 }, [ 'ngetherSpot02_9992_1222', 'ngetherSpotF01_9993_1223' ] );
		
# planned features:

* transporting node events (eventEmitter type), not only bubPubSubs
* direct file transfer between nodes

# demo:

* look at ng_demo.js

* creating a spot and connecting its bubpubsub bridge to your local bubpubsub instance
				ngether = new ngSpot(
					userconfig,
					function() {
						ngether._bubPubSubBridge_ToLocal(localBubPubSub);
						log.add('SPOT ready for action!', 'error', 'demoSystem');
					}
				);
				
* the very same for a hub.
				ngether = new ngHub(
					userconfig,
					function() {
						ngether._bubPubSubBridge_ToLocal(localBubPubSub);
						log.add('HUB ready for action!', 'error', 'demoSystem');
					}
				);
